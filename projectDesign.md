# TOPIC BUZZ

## General overview

The goal of topic buzz is to analyze trends in a way that we can see where ideas are coming from and who cares about them. Because I usually don't. 

This can be helpful if you're out of the loop on something and want to know where it came from. While I'm not quite certain how this will all work quite yet, an idea is that we try to identify topics and clusters with embeddings. Then, we try to see who else is talking about these topics so that we can see where the ideas came from. We will attach dates to people who talk about things to analyze origins. A possible idea to prevent stale ideas is to archive topics that haven't been updated in the past few days. We will try to display current topics in a visually useful graph.
